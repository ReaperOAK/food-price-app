        The wholesale egg prices refer to the price that retailers and distributors pay for eggs in bulk. Wholesale egg rates in India have been on the rise in recent years due to several factors. One major factor is the increase in feed costs, as the price of corn and soybeans, the main ingredients in chicken feed, have risen, which is a main expense for egg producers.
