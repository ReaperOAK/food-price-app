One of the primary determinants is the balance between demand and supply; when demand for eggs rises, prices tend to increase, whereas a surplus can lead to lower prices. The cost of production plays a crucial role as well, particularly the price of essential inputs such as bird feed, which can vary based on agricultural conditions and market trends. Disease outbreaks, especially recurring incidents of bird flu, can have a profound effect on the egg market. Such outbreaks often lead to a decrease in egg production and concerns about food safety, causing prices to spike. Furthermore, the impact of seasonal changes should not be overlooked; egg production typically sees a slight increase during the warmer months of summer due to improved laying conditions, while it often diminishes in the colder winter months when laying can be less consistent.
